# linux_benchmarking_tools

## About
A project to automated the installation process of various **benchmark tool** used in Linux.

## Benchmark Tools
1. [AIXPRT](https://www.principledtechnologies.com/benchmarkxprt/aixprt/index.php)

> ...an AI benchmark tool that makes it easier to evaluate a system's machine learning inference performance by running common **image-classification, object-detection, and recommender system workloads**.
> 
> ...support for the **Intel OpenVINO, TensorFlow, and NVIDIA TensorRT** toolkits to run image-classification and object-detection workloads with the **ResNet-50 and SSD-MobileNet v1** networks, as well as a Wide and Deep recommender system workload with the Apache MXNet toolkit. The test reports FP32, FP16, and INT8 levels of precision. Test systems must be running **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Windows 10**, and the minimum CPU and GPU requirements vary by toolkit. You can find more detail on hardware and software requirements in the installation package's readme files.

2. [OpenVINO Benchmark App](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/2018_R5/_samples_benchmark_app_README.html)

3. [MLxBench](https://mlbench.github.io/)

4. [Trtexec](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/samples/opensource/trtexec)
